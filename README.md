Liftopia Technical Excercise
=============================

## Overview
For this excercise, I've created a simple AngularJS application that retrieves data from 3 public API's. This app is intended to help skiers give some key information about Sierra at Tahoe. Yelp for ski stores information, worldweatheronline.com for weather ans snowfall info and elevation data from geonames.org.

I've utilized the yeoman for scaffolding, firebase for data storage and karma-jasmine for unit testing.

## Installation

      $ git clone https://github.com/nerdylocks/liftopia
      $ cd liftopia
      $ bower install
      
## Usage

      $ gtunt server
      
To see unit test results in action, you need to have karma installed globally.
      
      $ npm install -g karma
      $ karma start karma.conf.js
